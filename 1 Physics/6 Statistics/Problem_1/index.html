<p>To demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem using simulations, we begin by selecting a few distinct types of population distributions. Each distribution offers unique characteristics that help us examine how the CLT performs under different circumstances. Specifically, we use:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uniform Distribution</li>
</ol>
<p>The uniform distribution is a continuous distribution where all values in a given interval are equally likely. It is denoted as:</p>
<p>This distribution is symmetric and has a rectangular shape. It serves as a good example of a bounded, non-normal population.</p>

<li>Exponential Distribution</li>

<p>This distribution is highly right-skewed and unbounded above.</p>

<ol>
<li>Binomial Distribution</li>
</ol>
<p>The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of independent trials.</p>
<p>It represents the number of successes in 10 independent Bernoulli trials, each with success probability <span class="arithmatex">\(p = 0.5\)</span>.</p>
<p>Mean: <span class="arithmatex">\(\mu = np = 5\)</span></p>
<p>Variance: <span class="arithmatex">\(\sigma^2 = np(1 - p) = 2.5\)</span></p>
<p>Though discrete, the binomial distribution can appear approximately normal when <span class="arithmatex">\(n\)</span> is large and <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span> is not too close to 0 or 1.</p>
<p>To ensure statistical reliability, we simulate a large population size of 100,000 samples for each of these distributions. This allows us to treat them as representative of the full population and sample from them repeatedly in the next steps.</p>

</ul>
<p>Its skewness makes it a great candidate to test the CLT’s robustness under asymmetric conditions.</p>

<p>The <strong>binomial distribution</strong> is a discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of independent trials.</p>

</ul>
<p>Though discrete, the binomial distribution can appear approximately normal when <span class="arithmatex">\(n\)</span> is large and <span class="arithmatex">\(p\)</span> is not too close to 0 or 1.</p>
<hr/>
<p>To ensure statistical reliability, we simulate a large <strong>population size of 100,000</strong> samples for each of these distributions. This allows us to treat them as representative of the full population and sample from them repeatedly in the next steps.</p>
<p>These varied populations serve as the foundation for exploring how the sample means behave under the Central Limit Theorem.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="sampling-distributions">Sampling Distributions</h2>
<p>From each population, we draw samples of varying sizes to understand how the distribution of the sample mean evolves as the number of observations increases. Specifically, we consider the following sample sizes:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(n = 5\)</span>: Very small sample size. We expect the sample mean distribution to be quite influenced by the original population shape.</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(n = 10\)</span>: Still a small sample, but the convergence towards normality begins.</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(n = 30\)</span>: A commonly accepted threshold for the CLT to start showing strong effects.</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(n = 50\)</span>: A moderate sample size that typically yields near-normal behavior for the sample mean.</li>
</ul>
<p>For <strong>each sample size</strong>, we perform <strong>1000 independent sampling repetitions</strong> from the population. In each repetition, we draw a sample of the specified size and compute its sample mean.</p>
<p>This allows us to build an empirical sampling distribution of the mean for each case. The more repetitions we perform, the closer this distribution approximates the theoretical distribution predicted by the CLT.</p>
<p>In code, this process looks like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">sample_means = [np.mean(np.random.choice(population, size)) for _ in range(1000)]
</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>population</code> is the array of 100,000 values generated from a chosen distribution (e.g., uniform, exponential, binomial). The <code>np.random.choice</code> function selects <code>size</code> number of elements at random (with replacement by default), and <code>np.mean</code> computes the average.</p>
<p>This entire sampling process is repeated for each combination of distribution and sample size. The resulting sample means are stored and later used to visualize how they behave under the Central Limit Theorem.</p>
<p>Key purposes of this process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Observe convergence to normality visually.</li>
<li>Compare how different distributions affect the speed of convergence.</li>
<li>Study the role of sample size in the reduction of sampling variability.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the foundation for the visualizations and analyses that follow.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">sample_means = [np.mean(np.random.choice(population, size)) for _ in range(1000)]
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<h2 id="visualizing-convergence">Visualizing Convergence</h2>
<p>We use histograms to visualize how the sample means approach a normal distribution as sample size increases.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Central Limit Theorem enables us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplify inference for non-normal data.</li>
<li>Use sample statistics as reliable estimates of population parameters.</li>
<li>Apply statistical tests assuming normality in many real-world contexts.</li>
<li>Build robust predictive models that are grounded in sound probabilistic assumptions.</li>
<li>Conduct hypothesis testing even when population distributions are unknown.</li>
</ul>
<p>Its versatility makes it one of the most powerful and widely applicable results in all of statistics. Whether we're estimating averages in population surveys, monitoring quality in production lines, or building financial forecasts, the CLT gives us the confidence that our inferential tools are statistically valid — provided our sample size is sufficiently large.</p>
<p>Moreover, the simulations explored throughout this document demonstrate that regardless of the underlying distribution — be it symmetric, skewed, continuous, or discrete — the behavior of sample means consistently tends toward normality. This convergence provides not just mathematical elegance, but also a practical foundation for statistical analysis in the face of real-world complexity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simulations provide not just intuition but a practical toolkit for verifying theoretical expectations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This balance of theory and practice is what makes the CLT a cornerstone of modern data science, analytics, and empirical research.</p>

<h2 id="visualizing-convergence_1">Visualizing Convergence</h2>
<p>One of the most compelling ways to understand the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is through visual evidence. By graphing the sampling distributions of the sample means, we can <strong>see</strong> how the shape of these distributions evolves as the sample size increases.</p>
<p>In this section, we use <strong>histograms</strong> to represent the distributions of sample means, derived from various original population distributions (Uniform, Exponential, Binomial) and different sample sizes (<span class="arithmatex">\(n = 5, 10, 30, 50\)</span>).</p>
<h3 id="key-observations">🔍 Key Observations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Small Sample Sizes (<span class="arithmatex">\(n = 5\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(n = 10\)</span>)</strong>:</li>
<li>The shape of the sampling distribution is highly influenced by the original population.</li>
<li>For example, exponential populations (which are right-skewed) produce right-skewed sample mean distributions at small <span class="arithmatex">\(n\)</span>.</li>
<li>
<p>Uniform populations (which are symmetric) show some bell-shaped tendencies even at lower <span class="arithmatex">\(n\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moderate to Large Sample Sizes (<span class="arithmatex">\(n = 30\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(n = 50\)</span>)</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>Regardless of the original population's shape, the sampling distribution of the sample mean becomes approximately normal.</li>
<li>This is a clear demonstration of the CLT in action.</li>
<li>The variance of the sampling distribution shrinks, causing the histogram to become more concentrated around the true mean.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="visualization-method">📊 Visualization Method</h3>
<p>We used Python libraries such as <code>matplotlib</code> and <code>seaborn</code> to generate histograms of the sample means. The process is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>For each population type and sample size:</li>
<li>Generate 1000 sample means by random sampling.</li>
<li>Plot these values in a histogram.</li>
<li>
<p>Overlay a normal distribution curve using the theoretical mean (<span class="arithmatex">\(\mu\)</span>) and standard deviation (<span class="arithmatex">\(\sigma / \sqrt{n}\)</span>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare the resulting plots side by side:</p>
</li>
<li>This helps to visually assess the <strong>rate of convergence</strong> of each population.</li>
<li>It also highlights differences in convergence based on <strong>skewness</strong>, <strong>discreteness</strong>, and <strong>boundedness</strong> of the original distribution.</li>
</ol>

<p>This gradual transformation toward normality — from varied and sometimes skewed populations — reinforces the CLT’s significance.</p>
