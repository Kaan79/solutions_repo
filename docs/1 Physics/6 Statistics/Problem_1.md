## What is the Central Limit Theorem?


### üìö Theoretical Statement of the Central Limit Theorem

Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) random variables, each having a finite expected value $\mu = \mathbb{E}[X_i]$ and finite variance $\sigma^2 = \mathrm{Var}(X_i)$ for all $i$.

We define the **sample mean** of these $n$ observations as:

$$
\bar{X}_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i
$$

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that as the sample size $n$ increases, the distribution of the standardized sample mean approaches a standard normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution of the $X_i$.

Formally, we have:

$$
\frac{\bar{X}_n - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} \xrightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0, 1) \quad \text{as } n \to \infty
$$

This implies:

$$
\bar{X}_n \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n} \right) \quad \text{approximately, for large } n
$$

#### üîç Interpretation

- **$\mu$**: The true mean of the population.
- **$\sigma^2$**: The true variance of the population.
- **$n$**: Sample size.
- As $n$ increases:
  - The variance of $\bar{X}_n$ decreases.
  - The distribution of $\bar{X}_n$ becomes increasingly normal in shape.
  - The sample mean becomes a more precise estimator of the population mean.

This result is foundational because it allows statisticians to make **inferences** about the population using normal probability models, even if the underlying population is **not normally distributed**.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Conditions for CLT to Hold

While powerful, the Central Limit Theorem has certain conditions:

1. **Independence**: Observations must be independent.
2. **Identically distributed**: All $X_i$ come from the same distribution.
3. **Finite mean and variance**: $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ must exist and be finite.
4. **Sufficiently large $n$**: The required sample size depends on the shape of the population distribution.
   - If the population is roughly symmetric, $n \geq 30$ is usually sufficient.
   - If the population is highly skewed or heavy-tailed, larger $n$ may be needed.

#### Population Distributions
---
To demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem using simulations, we begin by selecting a few distinct types of population distributions. Each distribution offers unique characteristics that help us examine how the CLT performs under different circumstances. Specifically, we use:

1. Uniform Distribution

The uniform distribution is a continuous distribution where all values in a given interval are equally likely. It is denoted as:



This distribution is symmetric and has a rectangular shape. It serves as a good example of a bounded, non-normal population.

Mean: $\mu = \frac{1 + 0}{2} = 0.5$

Variance: $\sigma^2 = \frac{(1 - 0)^2}{12} = \frac{1}{12}$

2. Exponential Distribution

The exponential distribution is a continuous distribution commonly used to model time until an event (e.g., failure time, arrival time). It is defined as:



This distribution is highly right-skewed and unbounded above.

Mean: $\mu = \frac{1}{\lambda} = 1$

Variance: $\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{\lambda^2} = 1$

Its skewness makes it a great candidate to test the CLT‚Äôs robustness under asymmetric conditions.

3. Binomial Distribution

The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of independent trials.



It represents the number of successes in 10 independent Bernoulli trials, each with success probability $p = 0.5$.

Mean: $\mu = np = 5$

Variance: $\sigma^2 = np(1 - p) = 2.5$

Though discrete, the binomial distribution can appear approximately normal when $n$ is large and $p$ is not too close to 0 or 1.

To ensure statistical reliability, we simulate a large population size of 100,000 samples for each of these distributions. This allows us to treat them as representative of the full population and sample from them repeatedly in the next steps.

These varied populations serve as the foundation for exploring how the sample means behave under the Central Limit Theorem.

These varied populations serve as the foundation for exploring how the sample means behave under the Central Limit Theorem.

## Sampling Distributions

From each population, we draw samples of varying sizes to understand how the distribution of the sample mean evolves as the number of observations increases. Specifically, we consider the following sample sizes:

- $n = 5$: Very small sample size. We expect the sample mean distribution to be quite influenced by the original population shape.
- $n = 10$: Still a small sample, but the convergence towards normality begins.
- $n = 30$: A commonly accepted threshold for the CLT to start showing strong effects.
- $n = 50$: A moderate sample size that typically yields near-normal behavior for the sample mean.

For **each sample size**, we perform **1000 independent sampling repetitions** from the population. In each repetition, we draw a sample of the specified size and compute its sample mean.

This allows us to build an empirical sampling distribution of the mean for each case. The more repetitions we perform, the closer this distribution approximates the theoretical distribution predicted by the CLT.

In code, this process looks like the following:

```python
sample_means = [np.mean(np.random.choice(population, size)) for _ in range(1000)]
```

Here, `population` is the array of 100,000 values generated from a chosen distribution (e.g., uniform, exponential, binomial). The `np.random.choice` function selects `size` number of elements at random (with replacement by default), and `np.mean` computes the average.

This entire sampling process is repeated for each combination of distribution and sample size. The resulting sample means are stored and later used to visualize how they behave under the Central Limit Theorem.

Key purposes of this process:

- Observe convergence to normality visually.
- Compare how different distributions affect the speed of convergence.
- Study the role of sample size in the reduction of sampling variability.

This is the foundation for the visualizations and analyses that follow.
```python
sample_means = [np.mean(np.random.choice(population, size)) for _ in range(1000)]
```

## Visualizing Convergence

We use histograms to visualize how the sample means approach a normal distribution as sample size increases.

Key Observations:

- For small $n$, the shape of the population affects the sampling distribution.
- As $n$ grows, all sampling distributions become more bell-shaped.

We will include matplotlib/seaborn-based plots (refer to the notebook/script for visuals).

---

## Effects of Sample Size and Variance

- Larger sample sizes lead to **narrower** and **more symmetric** distributions.
- The **variance** of the sampling distribution is $\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$, meaning spread decreases with increased $n$.

Mathematically:

$$
\text{Var}(\bar{X}_n) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}
$$

---

## Applications of the CLT

### 1. Estimating Population Parameters

You can estimate $\mu$ using $\bar{X}_n$ with confidence intervals:

$$
\bar{X}_n \pm z \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

### 2. Quality Control

In manufacturing, checking sample means ensures consistent product quality.

### 3. Financial Modeling

In finance, average returns across time or assets benefit from CLT-based analysis.

## Conclusion

The Central Limit Theorem enables us to:

- Simplify inference for non-normal data.
- Use sample statistics as reliable estimates of population parameters.
- Apply statistical tests assuming normality in many real-world contexts.
- Build robust predictive models that are grounded in sound probabilistic assumptions.
- Conduct hypothesis testing even when population distributions are unknown.

Its versatility makes it one of the most powerful and widely applicable results in all of statistics. Whether we're estimating averages in population surveys, monitoring quality in production lines, or building financial forecasts, the CLT gives us the confidence that our inferential tools are statistically valid ‚Äî provided our sample size is sufficiently large.

Moreover, the simulations explored throughout this document demonstrate that regardless of the underlying distribution ‚Äî be it symmetric, skewed, continuous, or discrete ‚Äî the behavior of sample means consistently tends toward normality. This convergence provides not just mathematical elegance, but also a practical foundation for statistical analysis in the face of real-world complexity.

> Simulations provide not just intuition but a practical toolkit for verifying theoretical expectations.

This balance of theory and practice is what makes the CLT a cornerstone of modern data science, analytics, and empirical research.

## Visualizing Convergence

One of the most compelling ways to understand the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is through visual evidence. By graphing the sampling distributions of the sample means, we can **see** how the shape of these distributions evolves as the sample size increases.

In this section, we use **histograms** to represent the distributions of sample means, derived from various original population distributions (Uniform, Exponential, Binomial) and different sample sizes ($n = 5, 10, 30, 50$).

### üîç Key Observations

- **Small Sample Sizes ($n = 5$, $n = 10$)**:
  - The shape of the sampling distribution is highly influenced by the original population.
  - For example, exponential populations (which are right-skewed) produce right-skewed sample mean distributions at small $n$.
  - Uniform populations (which are symmetric) show some bell-shaped tendencies even at lower $n$.

- **Moderate to Large Sample Sizes ($n = 30$, $n = 50$)**:
  - Regardless of the original population's shape, the sampling distribution of the sample mean becomes approximately normal.
  - This is a clear demonstration of the CLT in action.
  - The variance of the sampling distribution shrinks, causing the histogram to become more concentrated around the true mean.

### üìä Visualization Method

We used Python libraries such as `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to generate histograms of the sample means. The process is as follows:

1. For each population type and sample size:
   - Generate 1000 sample means by random sampling.
   - Plot these values in a histogram.
   - Overlay a normal distribution curve using the theoretical mean ($\mu$) and standard deviation ($\sigma / \sqrt{n}$).

2. Compare the resulting plots side by side:
   - This helps to visually assess the **rate of convergence** of each population.
   - It also highlights differences in convergence based on **skewness**, **discreteness**, and **boundedness** of the original distribution.

### üìà Example Visualization Summary

| Distribution | $n=5$         | $n=10$        | $n=30$        | $n=50$        |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Uniform      | Moderate bell-shape | Clear bell-shape | Very normal-like | Very normal-like |
| Exponential  | Skewed        | Still skewed  | Near normal   | Normal         |
| Binomial     | Discrete steps | Smooth steps | Close to normal | Close to normal |

This gradual transformation toward normality ‚Äî from varied and sometimes skewed populations ‚Äî reinforces the CLT‚Äôs significance.
